# Reffects

Reffects is a Javascript framework for developing Event Driven Architectures, based on Clojure's [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame). It promotes a functional programming style with the use of pure functions as event handlers, and effects/coeffects to manage side effects/causes.
