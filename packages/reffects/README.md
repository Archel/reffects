# Reffects

Reffects is a Javascript framework for developing SPAs using an event-driven unidirectional flow architecture. It's based on ClojureScript's [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame). It promotes a functional programming style with the use of the effects as data patterns in which event handlers are pure functions, and effects/coeffects are used to manage side effects/causes.
